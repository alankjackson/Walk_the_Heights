## A walk through the Houston Heights

::: {layout-ncol="2"}
The Heights is one of the older neighborhoods in Houston, founded in 1891 [^1]. The core of the neighborhood is Heights Boulevard, and most of our walk will be on or near that street. There actually used to be a street car line that went down Heights and ended up downtown, but that ended in the 1930's [^2].<br><br> This is a 3 mile (one way) walk through the core of the neighborhood, with a look at some of the history and many of the interesting buildings. This walk is split in two, so that you could either do a 3 mile round-trip, or a six mile round-trip.<br><br> There will also be a number of optional side-trips that will be pointed out along the way.

## Starting point

We will start at the Waterworks, a fairly new development that took an old water treatment plant and repurposed the old buildings into a shopping and restaurant space.
